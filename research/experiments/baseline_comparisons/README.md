# Baseline Comparisons

This folder contains experiments comparing the RL agent against baseline methods.

## Planned Baselines

### 1. Random Policy
- Randomly selects prompt components
- Provides lower bound for performance

### 2. Rule-Based System
- Uses predefined rules for component selection
- Based on context type and conversation stage
- Represents traditional approach

### 3. Static Template Approach
- Uses fixed templates for each context
- No adaptation or learning
- Common in production systems

## Implementation Status

- [ ] Random policy baseline
- [ ] Rule-based system
- [ ] Static template approach
- [ ] Performance comparison scripts
- [ ] Statistical significance testing

## Expected Results

The RL agent should outperform all baselines, particularly in:
- Complex scenarios with multiple context factors
- Scenarios requiring adaptation
- Long conversation sequences
