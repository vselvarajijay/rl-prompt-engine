Simple Demo of Meta-Prompting System (RL Agent generates prompts for other LLMs)

This demonstrates the correct approach without requiring a trained model:
1. RL agent determines optimal prompt strategy
2. System generates META-PROMPTS that instruct other LLMs
3. Meta-prompts are used to generate actual appointment booking messages
