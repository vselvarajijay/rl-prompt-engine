üéØ WHAT THE AI DOES:
The AI learns to have conversations with potential car buyers and convince them to book appointments at your dealership.

üß† HOW IT LEARNS:
1. The AI tries different sales tactics (rapport, showing cars, offering deals, etc.)
2. It learns which tactics work best for different types of customers
3. Over time, it gets better at booking appointments

üë• CUSTOMER TYPES:
- Cautious Buyer: Takes time to decide, needs lots of information
- Price Shopper: Very focused on getting the best deal  
- Ready Buyer: Already knows what they want, ready to buy
- Research Buyer: Wants to learn everything before deciding
- Impulse Buyer: Makes quick decisions, easy to convince
- Skeptical Buyer: Hard to convince, needs lots of proof

üé≠ SALES TACTICS:
- Build Rapport: Build relationship and trust
- Ask Questions: Learn about customer needs
- Show Cars: Show available vehicles
- Address Concerns: Handle price/reliability worries
- Create Urgency: Create time pressure with limited offers
- Social Proof: Show others bought and are happy
- Offer Deals: Offer special deals and financing
- Book Appointment: Try to book the appointment

üìä UNDERSTANDING RESULTS:
- Success Rate: Percentage of customers who book appointments
- Action Distribution: Which tactics the AI uses most often
- Higher percentages = AI thinks that tactic works well

üîß CUSTOMIZATION:
Edit config.json to:
- Change customer behavior
- Adjust sales tactic effectiveness  
- Add new customer types
- Modify success criteria
